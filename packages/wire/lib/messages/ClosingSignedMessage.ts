/**
 * The `closing_signed` message is sent by the channel funder after
 * the `shutdown_message`. The funder chooses a fee it thinks
 * is fair, and signs the closing transaction with the scriptpubkey fields from
 * the shutdown messages (along with its chosen fee) and sends the signature.
 * The other node then replies similarly, using a fee it thinks is fair.
 * One of the benefits of mutual close is that the fee rate can be negotiated
 * down from the existing fee rate(which is generally expensive) to a more reasonable one.
 * In order for fee rate to converge, it has to be strictly between the last proposed
 * and the counterparty's last proposed value. This exchange continues using the
 * channelID until both agree on the same fee or when one side fails the channel.
