# Node DLC

Node DLC is a Discreet Log Contract (DLC) client written in TypeScript that allows you to create, manage, and execute DLCs on the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Overview

Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) are a type of smart contract that enables conditional payments on Bitcoin based on outcomes of real-world events, as determined by oracles. This implementation provides a complete toolkit for building DLC applications.

## Features

- üîê Complete DLC protocol implementation
- üì° IRC transport layer for peer communication
- üíæ RocksDB storage backend (migrated to classic-level)
- üîó Bitcoin blockchain integration
- üìä Oracle integration for external data
- üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive development tools

## Project Structure

This project was inspired by [Node-Lightning](https://github.com/altangent/node-lightning/) and has now absorbed its functionality. The monorepo contains the following packages:

### Core Packages

- `@node-dlc/bitcoin` - Bitcoin primitives and utilities
- `@node-dlc/core` - Core DLC functionality and types
- `@node-dlc/messaging` - DLC messaging protocol implementation
- `@node-dlc/leveldb` - Storage layer using classic-level
- `@node-dlc/transport` - Network transport layer (IRC)

### Supporting Packages

- `@node-dlc/bitcoind` - Bitcoin Core RPC and ZMQ client
- `@node-dlc/bufio` - Buffer I/O utilities
- `@node-dlc/chainmon` - Blockchain monitoring tools
- `@node-dlc/checksum` - Checksum utilities
- `@node-dlc/crypto` - Cryptographic functions
- `@node-dlc/logger` - Logging infrastructure
- `@node-dlc/noise` - Noise protocol implementation
- `@node-dlc/wire` - Lightning Network wire protocol
